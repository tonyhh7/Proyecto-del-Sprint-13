# ðŸ“Š Customer Churn Prediction Using Machine Learning (Sprint 13)

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This project focuses on **predicting customer churn** for a telecom company using **machine learning models**. The goal is to identify customers who are likely to leave and provide insights for retention strategies.

## ðŸ”§ Technologies Used
- **Python** (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-Learn)
- **Machine Learning Models** (Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest)
- **Data Preprocessing & Feature Engineering**

## ðŸ“ˆ Key Findings
- The **Random Forest model** achieved the highest accuracy with **X%**, outperforming other models.  
- The most influential features affecting churn were **contract type, monthly charges, and tenure length**.  
- **Business insight:** Customers on short-term contracts with high monthly charges were more likely to leave.

## ðŸ“‚ Repository Files
